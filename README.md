# HollowClock4

This repository contains the code and project files for creating a 3D printed floating clock using an Arduino Nano and a servo motor. The floating clock is a fascinating device that through the use of magnets gives the impression of being suspended.
Key features:
Uses an Arduino Nano as the main controller.
The servomotor that enables its movement.
The clock design is made to be 3D printed, and the files are inclsi in the project.
Includes source code for servomotor control and clock float management.
Detailed documentation and assembly instructions are provided in the repository to facilitate project implementation.
This project is suitable for makers, electronics and 3D printing enthusiasts even beginners. Whether you are a beginner looking for a challenging project, or an expert looking to further customize the design and functionality, this repository provides a solid foundation from which to start. We hope this project inspires and entertains you on your journey of creating and experimenting with Arduino and 3D printing. Enjoy!
